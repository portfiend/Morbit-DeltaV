  # Rule 4: Metafriending, Metagrudging

	This is a roleplay server, which means it's fair game for your character to for relationships to other characters. Your  character may also remember events from previous shifts.

	However, do not use this as an excuse to impact other people's rounds. For example, your character may find another character trustworthy from past experience, but you shouldn't be breaking the law or denying other people service for their sake (Metafriending).

	This especially goes if your characters have a negative relationship; for example, "getting revenge" for events from a previous round (Metagrudging).
