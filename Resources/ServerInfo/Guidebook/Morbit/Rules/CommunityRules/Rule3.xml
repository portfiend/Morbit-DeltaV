  # Rule 3: Metacomms

	Communicating out of the server is allowed, including voice chats, though please ask permission if you are livestreaming or screen sharing outside of the Morbit server.

	Talking about the current round in OOC is fine as well, including if you're dead, and especially if you're asking for help. However, do not abuse this to ruin the round for other people.
	
	For example: If you die in some random accident, it's fine to inform other people if you've died. However, if someone kills you, you should avoid mentioning it to give the person an in-character chance to roleplay Getting Away With It.
