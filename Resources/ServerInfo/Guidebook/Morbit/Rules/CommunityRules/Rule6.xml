  # Rule 6: Roleplay / Chat Conduct

	This server can be considered "medium/high-roleplay". However, we are not putting strict rules on how to make your characters and chat. For example, we will not enforce against "textspeak" / emoticons in chat. While the game has certain traits associated with each species, such as name conventions, you are not required to follow them.

	However, please do not do Species Discrimination here, which includes cyborgs, non-roundstart species, and sapient non-humanoid entities.
