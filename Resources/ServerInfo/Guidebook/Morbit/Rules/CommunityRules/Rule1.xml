  # Rule 1: Homebrew Deviants Community Standards

	Regardless of which spaces you come from, this server is associated with the Homebrew Deviants community, and that server's standards will apply here. Being removed from the HD server will have you removed from this server as well.

	The Homebrew Deviants community and their associated works may contain exploration of mature themes such as sexual content, violence, and abuse explored in the context of harm and recovery. Because we can't really put a "content warning" on our in-game interactions, please keep exploration of these themes light and/or vague. Do not roleplay your character abusing others.

	Be respectful to other people and their identities; no bigotry in the form of racism, ableism, transphobia, homophobia, and so on. This includes slurs - please avoid reclaiming or using slurs "ironically" as well, as this is hard to moderate. Also, please don't be too edgy here.
