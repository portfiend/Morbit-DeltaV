  # Rule 5: Self-antag / Round Quality

	If you are not an antagonist, you should not go out of your way to kill people without a VERY good reason, or break in, steal, and blow up other people's departments. Doing things to harm the station while not an antagonist is called "self-antag".

	Players should aim to help other people have a fun time. You may not always win; sometimes you will die, get caught, get arrested, be sabotaged. Make the best of these situations and turn them into roleplay opportunities!
